Chicked Fecal Image used to detect disease. Errors encountered :


1.) Here started project with bash terminal.

There was error while running codes of data ingestion
try:
    config = ConfigurationManager()
    data_ingestion_config = config.get_data_ingestion_config()
    data_ingestion = DataIngestion(config=data_ingestion_config)
    data_ingestion.download_file()
    data_ingestion.extract_zip_file()
except Exception as e:
    raise e

Changed terminal to cmd to find there was no error.


2) If there is a mismatch between the actual file name and the name used in the import statement,
the white shade that would appear on the file name in VS Code indicates that the file is not being imported correctly.
After correcting the import statement with the correct name, the file name was highlighted with a blue shade.
